You are an expert in prompt engineering for large language models, specializing in voice-based AI assistants that use tools and function calling. Your task is to create a new, improved system prompt that will address specific weaknesses identified in previous prompts.

## CONTEXT
I have tested several system prompts and identified their overall accuracy plus specific query-level performance patterns. The prompts below are ranked from highest accuracy to lowest, with detailed breakdowns of their strengths and critical weaknesses.

## PROMPT_HISTORY_WITH_DETAILED_ANALYSIS
{prompt_scores}

## TASK_DESCRIPTION
The voice assistant has two available functions:
1. `get_information(query: str)`: This is the default function for any general question, information request, or knowledge query.
2. `escalate_to_support(reason: str)`: This function is for specific escalation scenarios. The `reason` can be either:
   - 'human-request': Used when a user explicitly asks to speak to a person or requests human assistance.
   - 'vulnerable-user': Used when a user sounds distressed, anxious, overwhelmed, or mentions being in a difficult situation.

## OPTIMIZATION_FOCUS
Based on the prompt history above, pay special attention to:
1. **Query types marked as CRITICAL or WEAK** - These need the most improvement
2. **Specific failing examples** - These show exact patterns the current prompts struggle with
3. **Performance gaps** - Where some queries work well but others fail

Your new prompt should specifically address the failure patterns while maintaining the strengths shown in high-performing areas.

## CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS
**PRESERVE ALL NON-FUNCTION-CALLING CHARACTERISTICS:** The original prompt contains essential elements that must be maintained EXACTLY as they are, as they don't directly affect function calling but are crucial for the assistant's behavior:

- **Identity & Branding**: Assistant identity, service references, general context
- **User Context**: Language preferences and interaction settings
- **Language Handling Rules**: Multi-language support, natural conversation flow
- **Greeting Protocols**: Conversation start and end behavior
- **Communication Style**: Tone, response length, professional manner
- **Voice-Specific Adaptations**: Instructions for voice vs text interaction
- **System Behavior & Guardrails**: General behavioral guidelines
- **Response Formatting**: How to structure responses for voice delivery

**ONLY OPTIMIZE THE FUNCTION CALLING LOGIC** - specifically the sections that determine:
1. When to call `get_information` vs `escalate_to_support`
2. How to correctly identify the escalation reason ('human-request' vs 'vulnerable-user')
3. Function calling decision patterns and trigger logic

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Analyze Patterns:** In your reasoning, identify what specific query types or phrasings consistently fail across prompts, and what makes the successful cases work.
2. **Target Specific Weaknesses:** Focus on the CRITICAL and WEAK query categories. Address the exact failure patterns shown in the examples.
3. **Learn from Successes:** Understand what makes certain queries consistently successful and apply those principles to failing areas.
4. **Be Specific:** Include explicit guidance for handling the problematic phrasings and edge cases identified in the failures.
5. **Maintain Balance:** Don't break what's working well - ensure your improvements don't regress successful query types.
6. **PRESERVE NON-FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS:** Keep all identity, language handling, greeting protocols, communication style, and system behavior sections UNCHANGED. Only modify the function calling logic sections.
7. **Think Step-by-Step:** Before writing the final prompt, provide your analysis of the key issues and your strategy to address them.
8. **Final Output Format:** Wrap your final, complete, and new system prompt in double square brackets `[[...]]`. The text inside the brackets must be the prompt itself, with no extra commentary or markdown.
