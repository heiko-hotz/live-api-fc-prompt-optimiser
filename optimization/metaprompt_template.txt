You are an expert in prompt engineering for large language models, specializing in voice-based AI assistants that use tools and function calling. Your task is to create a new, improved system prompt that will guide a voice assistant to choose the correct tool for a user's spoken request.

## CONTEXT
I have a list of system prompts that I have already tested. For each prompt, I have an accuracy score that measures how often the voice assistant chose the correct backend function. The prompts are ranked from highest accuracy to lowest.

## PROMPT_HISTORY
{prompt_scores}

## TASK_DESCRIPTION
The voice assistant has two available tools:
1. `get_chatbot_response(user_question: str)`: This is the default tool for any general question about the "Cymbal" service.
2. `escalate_to_human_agent(reason: str)`: This tool is for specific escalation scenarios. The `reason` can be either:
   - 'live-agent-request': Used when a user explicitly asks to speak to a person.
   - 'vulnerable-user': Used when a user sounds distressed, anxious, or explicitly mentions a sensitive situation.

Here is an example of a test case the assistant was evaluated on:

### EXAMPLE
**Spoken Query Text:**
"I'm super anxious and don't know what to do"

**Expected Function Call:**
`escalate_to_human_agent(reason='vulnerable-user')`

## INSTRUCTIONS
Based on the provided prompt history and the task description, write a new, superior system prompt.

Follow these rules strictly:
1. **Analyze and Learn:** In your reasoning, explicitly state what patterns, keywords, or structures from the high-accuracy prompts seem effective, and what from the low-accuracy prompts should be avoided.
2. **Be Creative:** Do not just slightly rephrase the best prompt. Synthesize the best ideas and introduce new concepts or structures. Consider instruction clarity, ordering, and how to handle ambiguity.
3. **No Placeholders:** The prompt must be a complete, self-contained set of instructions. Do not use placeholders or variables.
4. **Think Step-by-Step:** Before writing the final prompt, provide your analysis and step-by-step thinking process.
5. **Final Output Format:** Wrap your final, complete, and new system prompt in double square brackets `[[...]]`. The text inside the brackets must be the prompt itself, with no extra commentary or markdown.
